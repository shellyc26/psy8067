My PI decided to help with increasing the N. My own data suggested that ~80% of neurons used glutamate. However, when my PI started recording, he got nearly reversed results from mine – nearly 80% GABAergic. We eventually traced the discrepancy to unconscious biases we each had in cell selection. Each of us was conditioned by previous studies we had performed to overlook cells of a certain shape. Ultimately, I repeated the experiment, forcing myself to record each and every cell that I encountered. The final result was approximately half and half. It was a lesson in unconscious bias\/data","targetRectangle":{"y":376.08621215820312,"x":132.11999893188477,"width":736.75440000000003,"height":580.46366400504905}},{"text":"Steve Mennerick, PhD","targetRectangle":{"y":89,"x":99,"width":759.96800063532544,"height":88.830279541015614}},{"text":"Prof of Psychiatry","targetRectangle":{"y":190.44745779037476,"x":98.599999904632568,"width":456.20960000000014,"height":65.436524963378901}},{"text":"Co-chair of DBBS Curriculum","targetRectangle":{"y":257.44745779037476,"x":98.599999904632568,"width":755.51629999999989,"height":65.436524963378929}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.00035007912466775983,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"1990F978D9983D8396C8CAEAAD3DBC90"}]}]}}]}} )
