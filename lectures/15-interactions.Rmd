Mixing categorical and continuous variables

## This time

Factorial ANOVA (two categorical predictors)

**WE STOPPED AT SLIDE 27**

class:inverse

The interaction of two or more categorical variables in a general linear model is formally known as **Factorial ANOVA**.

A factorial design is used when there is an interest in how two or more variables (a.k.a. factors) affect the outcome. 

* Rather than conduct separate one-way ANOVAs for each factor, they are all included in one analysis. 

* The unique and important advantage to a factorial ANOVA over separate one-way ANOVAs is the ability to examine interactions.

## Two categorical predictors

If both X and M are categorical variables, the interpretation of coefficients is no longer the value of means and slopes, but means and differences in means. 

Recall our Solomon's paradox example from a few weeks ago:

```{r, warning=F, message=FALSE, echo = F}
library(here)
solomon<- read.csv(file = '../data/solomon.csv')
```

```{r, echo = F}
solomon$PERSPECTIVE = ifelse(solomon$CONDITION %in% c(1,2), "self", "other")
solomon$DISTANCE = ifelse(solomon$CONDITION %in% c(1,3), "immersed", "distanced")
```

```{r}
head(solomon[,c("PERSPECTIVE", "DISTANCE", "WISDOM")])

solomon$PERSPECTIVE = factor(solomon$PERSPECTIVE)
solomon$DISTANCE = factor(solomon$DISTANCE)
```

---

### Model Means

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
solomon %>% 
  group_by(DISTANCE, PERSPECTIVE) %>% 
  summarize(meanWISDOM = mean(WISDOM, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

```{r, highlight.output = 11}
summary(lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon))

```

---


```{r, highlight.output = 12}
summary(lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon))
```

---

```{r, highlight.output = 13}
summary(lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon))
```

---
```{r, highlight.output = 14}
summary(lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon))
```

---


```{r, highlight.output = 20}
summary(lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon))
```

---


```{r, highlight.output = 21}
summary(lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon))
```

---

### What looks different? 

```{r}
anova(lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon))
```


---

### Plotting results

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
solomon.mod = lm(WISDOM ~ PERSPECTIVE*DISTANCE, data = solomon)
plot_model(solomon.mod, type = "int")
```

.small[The outcome was the time of the 10th failure (higher time, better at task). The experiment used a completely crossed, 3 x 3 factorial design. One factor was dot speed: .5, 1, or 1.5 revolutions per second (Slow, Medium, or Fast).  The second factor was noise condition: no noise, controllable noise, or uncontrollable noise.]

---

### Terminology: A Refresh

In a **completely crossed** factorial design, each level of one factor occurs in combination with each level of the other factor.

If equal numbers of participants occur in each combination, the design is **balanced**.  This has some distinct advantages (described later). 

| | Slow | Medium | Fast |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise | X | X | X |
| Controllable Noise | X | X | X |
| Uncontrollable Noise | X | X | X |

---

### Terminology: A Refresh

We describe the factorial ANOVA design by the number of **levels** of each **factor.** 

  - Factor: a variable that is being manipulated or in which there are two or more groups
  
  - Level: the different groups within a factor

In this case, we have a 3 x 3 ANOVA ("three by three"), because our first factor (speed) has three levels (slow, medium, and fast) and our second factor (noise) also has three levels (none, controllable, and uncontrollable).

### Questions 
```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
mean.summary = Data %>%
  group_by(Noise, Speed) %>%
  summarize(Time = mean(Time)) %>%
  spread("Speed", "Time")
mean.summary$Noise = as.character(mean.summary$Noise)
mean.summary$Marginal = rowMeans(mean.summary[2:4])
mean.summary[4,1] = "Marginal"
mean.summary[4,2] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[1]
mean.summary[4,3] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[2]
mean.summary[4,4] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[3]
mean.summary[4,5] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[4]
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% kable_styling() %>% group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3)
```


There are three important ways we can view the results of this experiment.  Two of them correspond to questions that would arise in a simple one-way ANOVA:


---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
mean.summary = Data %>%
  group_by(Noise, Speed) %>%
  summarize(Time = mean(Time)) %>%
  spread("Speed", "Time")
mean.summary$Noise = as.character(mean.summary$Noise)
mean.summary$Marginal = rowMeans(mean.summary[2:4])
mean.summary[4,1] = "Marginal"
mean.summary[4,2] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[1]
mean.summary[4,3] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[2]
mean.summary[4,4] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[3]
mean.summary[4,5] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[4]
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% kable_styling() %>% group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3)
```

1) Regardless of noise condition, does speed of the moving dot affect performance?



---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
mean.summary = Data %>%
  group_by(Noise, Speed) %>%
  summarize(Time = mean(Time)) %>%
  spread("Speed", "Time")
mean.summary$Noise = as.character(mean.summary$Noise)
mean.summary$Marginal = rowMeans(mean.summary[2:4])
mean.summary[4,1] = "Marginal"
mean.summary[4,2] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[1]
mean.summary[4,3] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[2]
mean.summary[4,4] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[3]
mean.summary[4,5] = colMeans(mean.summary[2:5], na.rm=T)[4]
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% kable_styling() %>% group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3)
```


1) Regardless of noise condition, does speed of the moving dot affect performance?

2) Regardless of dot speed, does noise condition affect performance?

---


```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) %>%
  row_spec(4, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#DD3E3E")
```

Regardless of noise condition, does speed of the moving dot affect performance?  
- Faster moving dots are harder to track and lead to faster average failure times.

Adding information about variability allows us a sense of whether these are significant and meaningful differences...

---

```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4.5}
library(ggpubr)
ggbarplot(data = Data, x = "Speed", y = "Time", add = c("mean_ci"), fill = "#DD3E3E", xlab = "Speed Condition", ylab = "Mean Seconds (95% CI)", title = "Failure time as a function of\nspeed condition") + cowplot::theme_cowplot(font_size = 20)
```

ANOVA will be able to tell us if the means are significantly different  and the magnitude of those differences in terms of variance accounted for.

---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) %>% 
  column_spec(5, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#DD3E3E")
```

Regardless of dot speed, does noise condition affect performance?  
- Performance declines in the presence of noise, especially if the noise is uncontrollable.

Adding info about variability allows us a sense of whether these are significant differences...

---

```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4.5}
ggbarplot(data = Data, x = "Noise", y = "Time", add = c("mean_ci"), fill = "#DD3E3E", xlab = "Noise Condition", ylab = "Mean Seconds (95% CI)", title = "Failure time as a function of\nnoise condition") + cowplot::theme_cowplot(font_size = 20)
```

The mean differences are not as apparent for this factor. The ANOVA will be particularly important for informing us about statistical significance and effect size.

---


```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) 
```

The **marginal mean differences** correspond to main effects. They tell us what impact a particular factor has, ignoring the impact of the other factor. 

The remaining effect in a factorial design is the ability to examine **conditional mean differences**.

                           DV_Med_U,
                           DV_Fast_N,
                           DV_Fast_C,
                           DV_Fast_U),
                  Speed = rep(c("Slow", "Medium", "Fast"), each = 60),
                  Noise = rep(rep(c("None", "Controllable", "Uncontrollable"), 
                                  each = 20), 3)) #repeat each label 20 times, then repeat that whole sequence 3 times

### One-way vs Factorial

.pull-left[
**Marginal Mean Differences**

Results of one-way ANOVA

```{r, eval = F}
lm(y ~ GROUP)
```

$$\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1D$$

]

.pull-left[
**Conditional Mean Differences**

Results of Factorial ANOVA

```{r, eval = F}
lm(y ~ GROUP*other_VARIABLE)
```

$$\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1D + b_2O + b_3DO$$

]

---
### The Linear Model Way

```{r}
summary(lm(Time ~ Noise*Speed, data = Data))
```

---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) %>%
  column_spec(2, background = "#EECACA") %>%
  column_spec(3, background = "#B2D4EB") %>%
  column_spec(4, background = "#FFFFC5") %>%
  column_spec(5, background = "grey", color = "white") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "white")
```

3) Are the marginal means for noise condition a good representation of what is happening within each of the dot speed conditions?

If not, then the noise condition effect *depends upon* dot speed.  We would have an interaction between noise condition and dot speed condition.

---


```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, echo = F}
library(sjPlot)
library(tidyverse)
model = lm(Time ~Speed*Noise, data = Data)
model.data = plot_model(model, type = "int")$data
model.data %>% ggplot(aes(x = x, y = predicted, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = .8), color = "black", width = .7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = .3, position = position_dodge(width = .8)) +
  scale_x_continuous("Speed Condition", breaks = c(1, 2,3), labels = c("Slow", "Medium", "Fast")) +
  labs(y = "Mean Seconds (95% CI)", fill = "Noise Condition", title = "Failure time as a function of\nnoise condition and speed condition") +
cowplot::theme_cowplot(font_size = 20)
```


The noise condition means are most distinctly different in the medium speed condition. The noise condition means are clearly not different in the fast speed condition. 

---

### Interpretation of interactions

The presence of an interaction qualifies any main effect conclusions, leading to "yes, but" or "it depends" kinds of inferences.

.pull-left[

```{r, message = F, warning = F, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,echo =F}
model.data %>% ggplot(aes(x = x, y = predicted, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = .8), color = "black", width = .7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = .3, position = position_dodge(width = .8)) +
  scale_x_continuous("Speed Condition", breaks = c(1, 2,3), labels = c("Slow", "Medium", "Fast")) +
  labs(y = "Mean Seconds (95% CI)", fill = "Noise Condition", title = "Failure time as a function of\nnoise condition and speed condition") +
cowplot::theme_cowplot(font_size = 10)
```

]

.pull-right[

Does noise condition affect failure time? 

"Yes, but the magnitude is strongest for medium speed, weaker for fast speed, and absent for the slow speed"
]

---

### Interactions are symmetrical

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', message = F, warning = F}
kable(mean.summary, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  group_rows(start_row = 1, end_row = 3) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "#EECACA") %>%
  row_spec(2, background = "#B2D4EB") %>%
  row_spec(3, background = "#FFFFC5") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "grey", color = "white") %>%
  column_spec(5, background = "white")
```

Are the marginal mean differences for speed a good representation of what is happening within each of the noise conditions?

If not, then we say that the speed condition effect *depends upon* noise condition.  


---

| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |

| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{2.}$ |
| Uncontrollable Noise | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{33}$ | $\mu_{3.}$ |
| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ $(\mu_g)$ |

The two main effects and the interaction represent 3 independent questions we can ask about the data. We have 3 null hypotheses to test.

1 null hypothesis refers to the marginal row means.

$$
\begin{aligned}
H_0&: \mu_{1.} = \mu_{2.} = \dots = \mu_{R.}\\
H_1&: \text{Not true that }\mu_{1.} = \mu_{2.} = \dots = \mu_{R.}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise |             $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{13}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{2.}$ |
| Uncontrollable Noise | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{33}$ | $\mu_{3.}$ |
| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ $(\mu_g)$ |


$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_r&= \mu_{r.} - \mu_{g} \\
H_0&: \alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \dots = \alpha_R = 0\\
H_1&: \text{At least one }\alpha_r \neq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

---


| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise |             $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{13}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{2.}$ |
| Uncontrollable Noise | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{33}$ | $\mu_{3.}$ |
| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ $(\mu_g)$ |

The main effect for dot speed (column marginal means) can be stated similarly:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta_c&= \mu_{.c} - \mu_{g} \\
H_0&: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \dots = \beta_C = 0\\
H_1&: \text{At least one }\beta_c \neq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
---

| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise |             $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{13}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{2.}$ |
| Uncontrollable Noise | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{33}$ | $\mu_{3.}$ |
| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ $(\mu_g)$ |

The interaction is the difference between each cell mean ( $\mu_{rc}$) and the grand mean ( $\mu_g$ or $\mu_{..}$) that remains *after* you remove the effects of A and B.

$$(\alpha\beta)_{rc} = (\mu_{rc} - \mu_g) - (\mu_r - \mu_g) - (\mu_c - \mu_g)$$

This simplifies down to:

$$(\alpha\beta)_{rc} = \mu_{rc} - \mu_r - \mu_c + \mu_g$$

---

| | Slow | Medium | Fast | Marginal |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| No Noise |             $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{13}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
| Controllable Noise |   $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{23}$ | $\mu_{2.}$ |
| Uncontrollable Noise | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{33}$ | $\mu_{3.}$ |
| Marginal | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mu_{.2}$ | $\mu_{.3}$ | $\mu_{..}$ $(\mu_g)$ |

The interaction null hypothesis can then be stated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\alpha\beta)_{rc}&= \mu_{rc} - \alpha_r - \beta_c  + \mu_{..} \\
H_0&: (\alpha\beta)_{11} = (\alpha\beta)_{12} = \dots = (\alpha\beta)_{RC} = 0\\
H_1&: \text{At least one }(\alpha\beta)_{rc} \neq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
---

### Putting it all together

$\alpha_r$ = row marginal means - grand mean; main effect of variable A (noise)

$\beta_c$ = column marginal means - grand mean; main effect of variable B (speed)

$(\alpha\beta)_{rc}$ = cell mean - $\alpha_r$ - $\beta_c$ + grand mean; interaction

$\epsilon_{irc}$ = error component (independent, normally distributed)

---
### Putting it all together


$$Y_{irc} = \mu + \alpha_r + \beta_c + (\alpha\beta)_{rc} + \epsilon_{irc}$$

If you subtract the grand mean ( $\mu_g$) from both sides and substitute in the treatment population means, you get...


$$\tiny Y_{irc} - \mu_g = (\mu_r - \mu_g) + (\mu_c - \mu_g) + (\mu_{rc} - \mu_r - \mu_c + \mu_g) + \epsilon_{irc}$$
--

Now, above is working with population parameters. We don't have those. We have sample estimates. Let's replace with the notation for sample estimates: 

$$\tiny (Y_{irc} - \bar{Y}_g) = (\bar{Y}_r - \bar{Y}_g) + (\bar{Y}_c - \bar{Y}_g) + (\bar{Y}_{rc} - \bar{Y}_r - \bar{Y}_c + \bar{Y}_g) + \\\tiny (\bar{Y}_{irc} - \bar{Y}_{rc})$$
---


$$\tiny (Y_{irc} - \bar{Y}_g) = (\bar{Y}_r - \bar{Y}_g) + (\bar{Y}_c - \bar{Y}_g) + (\bar{Y}_{rc} - \bar{Y}_r - \bar{Y}_c + \bar{Y}_g) + \\\tiny (\bar{Y}_{irc} - \bar{Y}_{rc})$$

In words, this translates to:

> score - grand mean = main effect of A + main effect of B + interaction term + residual error

\begin{aligned}
\large SS_{\text{total}} &= \sum_{r=1}^R\sum_{c=1}^C\sum_{i=1}^{N_{rc}}(Y_{rci}-\bar{Y}_{...})^2 \\

### Partitioning Variability 

One part will represent variability **within groups**. This within-group variability is variability that has nothing to do with the experimental conditions (all participants within a particular group experience the same experimental conditions). 

The other part will be **between-group variability**.  This part will include variability due to experimental conditions.  We will further partition this between-group variability into parts due to the two main effects and the interaction.

---

If the design is balanced, then:

$$SS_{\text{total}} = SS_R + SS_C + SS_{RxC} +SS_{\text{within}}$$

$df$, $MS$, and $F$ ratios are defined in the same way as they were for one-way ANOVA. We just have more of them.
$$
\begin{aligned}
df_{Total} &= N-1 \\
df_{Total} &= abn - 1 \\
df_R &= R-1 \\
df_C &= C-1 \\
df_{RxC} &= (R-1)(C-1) \\
df_{within} &= ab(n-1) \\
&= df_{total} - df_{R} - df_C - df_{RxC}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

$$SS_{\text{total}} = SS_R + SS_C + SS_{RxC} +SS_{\text{within}}$$

$df$, $MS$, and $F$ ratios are defined in the same way as they were for one-way ANOVA. We just have more of them.

\large MS_{within} &= \frac{SS_{within}}{df_{within}} \\

$$

$MS_{within}$  is the pooled estimate of the within-groups variance. Only random variation.  $MS_R$, $MS_C$, and $MS_{RxC}$ has random variation, but also systematic variability

If nulls are true, these ratios will be ~1. >1 indicate that systematic variability is present. If large enough, we reject the null hypothesis.

### Degrees of freedom

The degrees of freedom for the different $F$ ratios might not be the same. Different degrees of freedom define different theoretical $F$ density distributions for determining what is an unusual value under the null hypothesis.


Which is to say, you might get the same $F$-ratio for two different tests, but they could have different $p$-values, if they represent different numbers of groups.

### Interpretation of significance tests

```{r}
fit = lm(Time ~ Speed*Noise, data = Data)
anova(fit)
```

Interpretation?

--
All three null hypotheses are rejected.  This only tells us that systemic differences among the means are present; follow-up comparisons are necessary to determine the nature of the differences. 
---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fit = lm(Time ~ Speed*Noise, data = Data)
anova(fit)
```

The significant interaction qualifies the main effects:

- The magnitude of the speed main effect varies across the noise conditions.

- The magnitude of the noise main effect varies across the speed conditions.

---

Different combinations of main effects and interactions yield different shapes when plotted. An important skill is recognizing how plots will change based on the presence or absence of specific effects. 

Main effects are tests of differences in means; a significant main effect will yield a difference -- the mean of Group 1 will be different than the mean of Group 2, for example.

Interactions are tests of the differences of differences of means -- is the difference between Group 1 and Group 2 different in Condition A than that difference is in Condition B, for example.

## Effect size

All of the effects in the ANOVA are statistically significant, but how big are they?  An effect size, $\eta^2$, provides a simple way of indexing effect magnitude for ANOVA designs, especially as they get more complex.

$$\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{\text{effect}}}{SS_{\text{total}}}$$
If the design is balanced...

$$\small SS_{\text{total}} = SS_{\text{speed}} + SS_{\text{noise}}+SS_{\text{speed:noise}}+SS_{\text{within}}$$
---


```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '') # print NA's as blank

eta.tab = as.data.frame(lsr::etaSquared(fit))
aov.fit = anova(fit)
eta.tab$source = rownames(eta.tab)
eta.tab[4, "source"] = "Residuals"
eta.tab$SS = aov.fit$`Sum Sq`
eta.tab[5, "source"] = "Total"
eta.tab[5, "SS"] = sum(eta.tab$SS)
eta.tab[,c("source", "SS", "eta.sq", "eta.sq.part")] %>%
  kable(., digits = 2,  format = "html",
        col.names = c("Source", "SS", "$\\eta^2$", '$\\text{partial }\\eta^2$'), 
         row.names = F, escape = F) %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "10em")
```

The Speed main effect accounts for 8 to 9 times as much variance in the outcome as the Noise main effect and the Speed x Noise interaction.

**If the design is balanced:**

The variance accounted for by any effect is unique. There is no ambiguity about the source of variance accounted for in the outcome.

The sum of the $\eta^2$ for effects and residual is 1.00.

One argument against $\eta^2$ is that its magnitude depends in part on the magnitude of the other effects in the design. If the amount of variability due to Noise or Speed x Noise changes, so to does the effect size for Speed.

$$\eta^2_{\text{speed}} = \frac{SS_{\text{speed}}}{SS_{\text{speed}} + SS_{\text{noise}} + SS_{\text{speed:noise}}+ SS_{\text{within}}}$$

An alternative is to pretend the other effects do not exist and reference the effect sum of squares to residual variability.

$$\text{partial }\eta^2_{\text{speed}} = \frac{SS_{\text{speed}}}{SS_{\text{speed}} + SS_{\text{within}}}$$
---

One rationale for partial $\eta^2$ is that the residual variability represents the expected variability in the absence of any treatments or manipulations.  The presence of any treatments or manipulations only adds to total variability.  Viewed from that perspective, residual variability is a sensible benchmark against which to judge any effect.

$$\text{partial }\eta^2_{\text{effect}} = \frac{SS_{\text{effect}}}{SS_{\text{effect}} + SS_{\text{within}}}$$

Partial $\eta^2$ is sometimes described as the expected effect size in a study in which the effect in question is the only effect present.

---

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '') # print NA's as blank

eta.tab = as.data.frame(lsr::etaSquared(fit))
aov.fit = anova(fit)
eta.tab$source = rownames(eta.tab)
eta.tab[4, "source"] = "Residuals"
eta.tab$SS = aov.fit$`Sum Sq`
eta.tab[5, "source"] = "Total"
eta.tab[5, "SS"] = sum(eta.tab$SS)
eta.tab[,c("source", "SS", "eta.sq", "eta.sq.part")] %>%
  kable(., digits = 2,  format = "html",
        col.names = c("Source", "SS", "$\\eta^2$", '$\\text{partial }\\eta^2$'), 
         row.names = F, escape = F) %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "10em")
```

Partial $\eta^2$ will be larger than $\eta^2$ if the ignored effects account for any variability.

The sum of partial $\eta^2$ does not have a meaningful interpretation.
